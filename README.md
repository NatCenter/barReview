Bar Review
  
  Introduction: Since that the lockdowns are going to end very soon. People want to go out and feel safe in a enclosed space with lots of people. There is a lack of information for what bars around town are following covid restrictions in these private business.  


Purpose and motivation for this project: The main purpose for the project is that some bars have mixed rules when it comes to staying safe from covid. Some have to need maskes some dont even enforce  it. As well has have an organized list that how the vibe of the bar is. As well if it is worth it to head out on town on the weeked. Making a place worth your time to go to.
