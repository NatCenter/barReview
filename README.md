# Bar View
  
  Introduction: Since that the lockdowns are going to end very soon. People want to go out and feel safe in a enclosed space with lots of people. There is a lack of information for what bars around town are following covid restrictions in these private business.  


Purpose and motivation for this project: The main purpose for the project is that some bars have mixed rules when it comes to staying safe from covid. Some bars have to have masks, vaccine cards, and other restrictions that may or may not be enfored. Making a place worth your time to go to. 

How does the application work: A user logs in or creates a profile. They see a list of bars in Nashville. They click on a bar on the  that looks interesting to see what kind of reviews they have. Once they are in the bar page they can see a list of all the covid restrictions that they have in place.

# Difficulties & challenges
The biggest difficulty was making all the forms dynamically rendered and being able to edited by user input.

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

# npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
# npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
